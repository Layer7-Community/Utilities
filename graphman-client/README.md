# Graphman Client Has Moved

Based on feedback from the community, we moved the Graphman client to its own repository in the community [here](https://github.com/Layer7-Community/graphman-client). We did this to make it easier for people to work directly and only with the Graphman client without having to pull the entire Utilities repository.
